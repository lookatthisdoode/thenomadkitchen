I love the salad with mix of many fresh vegetables and good seasoning (the shrimp salad is especially nice), if you feel super hungry you will find good plates cooked with fresh and health products. Mediterranean style :) The atmosphere is like "eating surrounded by trees üå≥", you'll seat on a terrace upstairs, protected from the rain and in a quite peaceful street üòä (last month also they added a room with AC if you want to cool down) ‚ùÑÔ∏è`,

      text: `The rooftop mood is another world. Food is great. So glad that I could taste Chimichurri sauce here in Danang which is from Argentina and usually served with lamb in Argentina. If I had known they have Chimichurri sauce, I would have definitely ordered lamb. Anyway, I had Gambas al Ajillo as a starter and beef steak and a chorizo burger for me and my mom's main dish. Steak was chopped so easy to eat and good. A chorizo burger, more precisely, it's a chorizo patty burger. I guess this one is the signature burger of this restaurant. It was good too, a little bit spicy(It seems there is chili sauce inside the burger) but made the burger more delicious. and fries served with the burger were perfect. if you are tired of pho, Just visit here. Most of all, staffs can speak English and the chef is kind and friendly.`,
